For this assignment, I put out a bunch of test cases that would be great for you to go through.

Remember, the core functionality of the select is our main priority.

Also, we need to test that it is customizable and flexible.

So first, we all test that we can pass in a custom render option and have it working.

That's the first test case.

Then make sure that the option selected function is called with the correct option and the index.

If it's passed next, make sure that the bottom level changes.

If a new item is selected from the list, then we also want to take a snapshot of the selected option

states, the big states and the states when the options menu is open.

This would be really great to make sure that if anything at all changes from our component in future,

then we are aware from our unique test.

So go ahead and have fun with this.

Be sure to share your solution and we would share feedback on what you did.
