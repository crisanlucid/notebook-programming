For this assignment, you would need to populate the Typography Success Foundation found now in the

previous lesson we did for the body size and weight, the head in size and the heading weights, and

those are just examples in your actual design system, you would need the font family, you would need

the line heights, the letter spacing and so much more.

So your assignment is to go ahead and define the actual typography of this project, taking into account

all of these values that are paired right here and also making use of the variables that you defined

in this file.

Now, if they are values that you then define, you can always go back to the variables and add them

there and then consume them from the typography foundation found.

So go ahead and define that for the headend, for the body, and be sure to use the values that are

allocated right here.

Once you're done, please share with me.

Please share with the rest of the team so that we can provide feedback on your work and also learn a

thing or two from you.
