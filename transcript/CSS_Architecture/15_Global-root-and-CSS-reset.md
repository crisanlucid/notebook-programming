The next phase will be tackling is a global success for this far is going to take care of two things.

First, the foundation and next, the base.

The foundation is exposing everything we've defined in the foundation folder.

And the base is going to contain two things.

Number one, a definition of root variables for success.

And number two, a reset of the browser to improve browser consistency.

Let's start with the Foundation for the Foundation.

All we need to do is import all of these files here.

Now we are going to create a file in the foundation called All That Success.

And this is going to import.

Variables, and I'm importing them in the order that they are used.

Then all import costs.

Then all imports.

Typography and finally, all import and mixes.

Now, in the global success, I will create a comment header, this is going to be called Foundations

and in here I can import.

Foundation slash.

Oh, and that should be foundation, and that's it for the foundations.

Next, we have the base.

And the base is going to have a success reset, and it's also going to have a good definition now for

the success reset.

I'm going to be using a package called Normalized Success, and it's a really interesting package.

It makes browsers render all elements consistently, at least the basic ones that we do not have to

worry about much in compatibility for different browsers.

Now, this is the CSAs version.

But since we are using SaaS, we are going to use the normalize access version.

Now, it's available as an NPM package.

And to install this, all we need to do is run, npm, install.

So what I would do is we need a new NPM project so we can install that package.

So this is my terminal CD into access.

And here I'm going to warn Young in age, that's why.

And this creates a basic package for Jason here, I'm going to call this package that E x because that's

what the package is going to be in the name of speech and access.

Then I'm going to normalize access.

OK, so we have that package now in the global what we are going to do is import a reset so in the source

or create a base.

And in here I'm going to have on this call we said that success as usual.

I have some comments, boilerplate just to put everything organized now in here.

What we want to do is import the reset.

And this imports from module's normalize success, normalize import now, and since we have no modules,

you can go ahead and track that.

And the import passes, if you import this model didley, you would immediately output all the access

needed to normalize default elements across all browsers.

We could use import, normalize, slash, import now.

But I'm going to explain why we are using load modules in a little less.

OK, so now we have imported the normalized access and what this will do is it's going to spit out all

of the default access that normalizes our process.

So now we can go back to our global the successful in our source and import BS reset.

So we've reset all of the start in our browser.

Next thing we want to do is define a wood.

Now, in the base, I'm going to define a wood start success and the wood is going to define a roots

for the Eskimo documents and it's going to have default ccws variables.

Remember, in our foundation, when we are defining colonies, for example, we are using a variable

or falling back to this one.

Now in the wood we can define Dokes as verbals.

So it doesn't have to fall back to this one, but it would just use it.

So the wood defines all of the as we are both for the design system on the as Shamo Wood elements that

we the user can just import access and then automatically rewrite all of the rules on the road to define

them.

We can start with E, let's say we want that to define for the body text color.

This is going to be dark, OK, but this is not really going to work because access is not fully compatible

with Scousers variables.

So we have to kind of embed this variable using the special syntax.

So this is going to assign this case as well to the value of this Sarsae variable.

Now, I'm going to paste in all of the defaults that we've had so far in the project just to save us

some time.

OK, so we have for the body color, we are for the Butson primary, we have for the form, we have

the font sizes and phone waits for both the body and the headings.

OK, so this is our route.

It defines all of the different variables on the estimate documents.

Now, I would come back to the global success and I would import base slash would not access.

Now this is our global file.

First, it imparts the foundations to declare all of those variables and then it imports the reset to

reset the browser for compatibility or for consistency across browsers.

Next, it imports the wood so that we can define some default CSS as we both on the road, and that

we if anybody wanted to customize the button color, they could overwrite the access variable that matches

this one.

And the whole system changes.
