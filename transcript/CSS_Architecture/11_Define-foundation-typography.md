The next part of a foundation is the typography.

This is going to be almost exactly what we did in the crossfire.

We want to define the typography styles that we would use when crafting our components.

First, I'm going to have some typography styles for the body.

So create a comment header called Body Six Sizes.

I'm going to define the body for size and body font, which the default is going to be accessible,

which defaults to F's small XPoint eats on five REM and the font which is going to default and the which

is 400.

We can also define typography styles for the head in here.

I would have a comment about this, which is great.

You see Hedin text sizes.

And I'll paste a bunch of them.

As you can see, we are consuming the defined variables from our variables that X as far as default

for the variables and we are mapping them to the actual variables will be using in our app.

So if we wanted to start a component that requires an edge for this is the way we would use and the

user could customize this variable or this variable value if they want to overwrite that.

Let's also add one for Hedin.

Font Wheatus.

And of course, they should be font sizes.

Same thing here.

OK, so for the fund, which is what I have and is following the exact same concept this time around,

consuming values from the FWC stack, OK, so the typography file can help you define font sizes from

which font family's for the different components of your application.

For example, if we wanted to have fun families for weddings and for the body, this would be the file

to put this into.
