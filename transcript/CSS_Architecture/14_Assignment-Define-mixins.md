Before we talk about the assignment for this lesson, one important part of every design system is based

on the amount of space that your system defines between components, between levels.

It's really important.

You can see an example in the Shopify design system.

Every component follows a specific skill of space.

So in the variables that says we are going to add another item to the list.

This would be called spaceborne.

And this would define the global fixed set of Space Invaders.

I'll scroll down.

I would add a comment header and this would see space.

Now this would be a map, so spacing is going to have a specific set of values, the first one being

extra, extra, extra small.

And this would be zero point two five RAM, which is actually four pixels.

So if you want to move and eliminate the minimum, you can move.

That element is four pixels.

So of course we can have two pixels if we need two space elements by two pixels in our design system.

But the most important point is we need to have a fixed skill.

So I'm just going to be seeing the other values.

And at a default, this.

So this other species values that our design system is going to have, so every single element of species

is going to respect this skill, not that we have this variable.

The assignment is to create a helpful mix in that we can use to give Margine top podding left and things

like that with these spacing.

So, for example, in the make sense for what I need or what your assignment is, is to create a mixing

that can be used like this.

I'd include.

Magine top.

And this is going to take an extra, extra, extra small, and if the user puts in extra, extra, extra

small, then the margin top should be this value from the speccing.

So this should spit out margin top of zero point to five.

Reem.

So how many of this show, maybe margin, top margin left, Padian left and so on?

So these are different skinny mixes and each of them should be able to take in a specific value from

us, kill maybe small.

And.

Maybe Lache.

And this should give the specific styles for that value, so in our case, for the left, we are using

large.

So this is going to be padding left of trim.

OK, so that's the assignment.

Please have fun doing this.

Make sure you wear out the mixing and share with the rest of the group so we can review it, share some

feedback and learn a thing or two from you.

You can also send this to me directly.

So we review together.
