Has the assignment for this lesson in the last lesson, we defined class for the foundation of our system

and we were specific with maybe for the body, the Butson, the forms.

So for this assignment, I would like you to define specific colors in the on this call colors that

says Azfar for the ABA and the floating auction button.

So for the ABA, you can select any of the abacus.

You'd realize that we have one variance with the white background and some ish text.

So also we have another variance with the primary background and we have some white text and then we

have another one with the white background and we have some elevation.

Remember the elevation we talked about in the last assignment?

Then we also have a primary one with another elevation.

So go ahead and define some of the foundational colors for the background of the abar, for the elevation

of the ABA, for the text color of the ABA.

Next, you would do the same thing for the floating auction button.

And they are right far to the right.

If I could just find them here.

OK, so this is the fab or the floating auction button.

Notice that there is the default state, there is the click state where the background color completely

changes when it's clicked and then there is the elevation of the button.

So this should have default values.

And if the user wants to customize how elevated the button is, that should be possible.

So define the specific colors for the floating action button and for the abar and make sure you use

siestas variables and defaults.

Once you're done, please share your solution so that we can collaborate, share some feedback and talk

about what you have.
