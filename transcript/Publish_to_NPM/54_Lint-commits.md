We have a young common, but someone could still make a mistake.

Let's go ahead and add a lynching for our covid messages.

That way, when the user commits, there's a hook that takes the message of the committee to make sure

it follows conventions to do this.

We are going to install two packages at Def Chameleon's and also a package called Config Conventional.

Again, this is going to make sure that the message follows the conventional chametz format so we can

also install a package called Huskie like we talked about, so that we can tap into networks and run

this committee.

Clinton on the specific hook.

Next, we're going to create a configuration called chametz lens.

That conflict suggests then we are going to modulo the exports and object.

And in here, we want to add extents with an array and put in the config conventional that we we register

the conventional chametz with Chameleon's.

Now, the final step is to configure the Huskey hook.

So in the package that Jason ordered Huskey.

And that hooks and the hook we're interested in this case is Comite message, and this hook is called

immediately after a user inputs the commit.

And I'm going to say commits Lynch E and we'll need to pass in all of the Huskie get permit us to commit

links.

So just pass in Huskey get.

OK, so it looks like we are set.

Let's go ahead and commit with competition because we can compete normally if we commit normally let's

do this so we get at everything and get it wrong.

Now you can see that Husky runs the commit message, who wants immediately after we type in the commit,

then we have an error that says the subject may not be empty, the type may not be empty, and that's

really cool.

So we have Chameleon's running.

So what do we want to do is run and commit.

Then Selek, the fix and maybe a scope of ducks and maybe a short description at Comet Lynch.

And maybe a longer discussion at length, long description.

And are there any changes?

No.

Does this affect any open issues?

No, for now.

And now it runs the commission, it's successful.

Now, if we check our gridlock, you can see that it follows the format.

OK, so in this lesson we installed Chameleon's and this is going to use Huskie in our package to Jason

to listen to the comet message hook and one comet lens on the comet that the user wrote that we all

of our comets can follow the same convention called conventional comets.
