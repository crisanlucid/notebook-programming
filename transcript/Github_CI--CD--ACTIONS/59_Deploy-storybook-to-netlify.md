One last piece of the puzzle is making a storybook application available to the rest of the world.

We need to host it somewhere.

Now, the best solution for static sites nowadays is Nordley fight, and I highly recommend them.

And most of all, it's completely free for unlimited websites.

So to get started, the first thing we need is a command to be able to build Storybrooke.

Now in the area, we have the build story.

But come on now, we need to add a package script at the.

This would be built storybook.

And what this would do, first of all, is one young build to build the application because we need

the seats available and the components are available for us to be able to work correctly.

So we have to build on that LFI and then we are going to one young learner, one build the story book.

So first we build the application and then we build story book, which is going to want to build story

book from the real package.

OK, so that looks good and that's really all we need for nullify.

Now we are going to get add everything and then yankovich at DACA and a defibrillate script and get

pushed s to M..

OK, so now what we said nullify and if you don't have an account go ahead and sign up for a free one.

I'm going to go ahead and log into my dashboard and the first thing you need to do is click on the new

site from Git Button.

This would require me to grant access to your GitHub or git lab or BitBucket account or grant access

to my GitHub accounts because that's where our repositories will start.

Then I would search for my repository, which is called geostrategy.

Then I would select my repository and now I would have the option of selecting which branch I want to

deploy by default.

I have just my stuff.

Next, I will need to provide a build scriptura nullify so that I will know how to build our project.

So if you're deploying an angular project or a real project, you would most likely have a build scripture

built for production.

In this case, we have the young build storybook command that we just set up at the wood packaged adjacent.

For now, the publisher is going to require a publish folder.

Where is our static ascherman site that we want to deploy now in order to know that let's run the yen,

build stable command from our roots and see what happens first.

It's running Jianwen build.

Then it's running storybook and notice that it creates a storybook folder in the react package right

there, and that is the result of the build and the storybook package has an index of extremophile,

which is an actual static file.

Then it has a bunch of scripts.

So this is the file we want to deploy.

So we are going to point that file to notify.

So this would be packages.

React, slash, storybook static, so this is the fodder, that's when the fight is going to deploy.

So I would deploy site nullify generates a random name for this site and let's drill down into that

deployment to see the locks.

First of all, notify Clone's, our repository then.

Now it's installing the package dependencies using Yune.

Now, once it's done installing the packages, it once builds up Youngsville Storybook, which builds

the mono repository packages then it wants.

The boots to rebel command.

And you can see all that output.

I'm just going to go down to the bottom and you can see that it successfully builds the result and then

that the fire is done with the build process and its sister site is life.

And that's great.

So now let's click on the preview button to see if this was successful.

All right.

That's awesome.

And just like that, we have our application in the cloud.

That's really good for so little effort.

So what you would want is to revisit your site and visit the settings and change the name to something

more memorable like that up.

I would save that and this would be divided up.

And that will take us directly to our design system.

Storybook dashboard.
