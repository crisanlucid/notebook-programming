So we've talked about design systems, let's take some time to look at some practical examples, most

of the popular design systems are created by large companies.

The carbon design system here, for example, is created by IBM and is really popular.

When you visit a website for a company that defines or describes the design system, there's a number

of things that you would expect to see.

First, you would expect to see some guidelines or some policies about Content's intention as usability

spacing for that design system.

Now, this might also be the foundation or the style guide for the design system.

So to learn about design system, you should have a look at the colors and explanation of why those

colors were chosen, what those colors represent.

You should have a look at the accessibility guidelines.

What is the focus?

What is the target?

You should have a look at the typography.

What does the typography represent?

What is the message they are trying to pass to the customers or to the users of the design system?

You should have a look at the icon sets.

What I can set.

Does the design system use and why did they choose to go with these icons?

Do they use a standard icon library or did they quit their own icon library from scratch?

Next, there is almost always a section for components and the components represent actual implementation

of this design system for products.

So, for example, the accordion is a representation of what this design system would mean for an accordion

use case.

Even though some design systems wouldn't explicitly use the atomic design pattern, you would be able

to identify these concepts with a closer look.

For example, if you look at the accordion code snippet, you would realize that it's a combination

of an accordion item component, a paragraph and a parent accordion component.

All of these coming together to create an accordion molecule that can be reused in the application.

It's always so much fun to see the implementation of a design system by a group of engineers.

That way, it gives you an idea of how your own design systems should turn up.

At the end of the day, he has a date because it has a date in input and that would most likely be an

item with a combination of text would come together to form a simple molecule for picking dates.

So take some time to go through these components, see exactly what's important.

That's the use of the component that's super important.

There's the star of the component.

That's how you can customize the styles of a component.

You can see there's a clear description that you can override the styles of the component using the

class names.

There's also a description of the typography, of the structure of this component, the spacing and

some recommendations.

You can also have a look at the code of the design system in the specific implementation of the programming

language you're interested in.

There's also some usability guidelines and how this component respects assessable rules and how you

can make sure you do not just respect these rules when customizing the component.

So make sure that you check this out.

It would give you a really good example of what a good design system is.

Now, let's have a look at what Microsoft did so Microsoft uses to design a system called Fluence,

or this is what the creator and you can visit whatever platform is of interest to you.

I'm just going to stick with Web and they have a style section.

And this would kind of be like a foundation.

It defines us, defines elevation, defines iconography, typography and some other additional pieces.

They have that for their products, for neutral use cases and some others that I use across all the

products they have now.

This is just the styles.

They still have the controls, which is an implementation of the components of the design system.

Notice that the terminologies vary between design systems, but the actual implementation is consistent.

For example, we have basic inputs.

It's a checkbox component and the checkbox is a combination of these checkbox and some text.

We have the combo box, which is a combination of an input box with a dropdown.

We have a written component of such box component.

All of these are implementations of their design system in code.

So make sure you check this out.

And I also highly recommend checking out the GitHub repository because it would give you some insight

into what we are going to achieve.

OK, so this is the current design system by IBM and this is the flaw in the design system by Microsoft.

Your assignment for this lesson would be to fetch out to other design system that you really admire

documents.

Two really interesting components that you can find from the design systems.

For example, it could be a table component.

And you talk about what exactly was important in that design system, for example, IBM.

Uses the usage style code and accessibility guidelines when defining their components, but fluency

uses the best practices, the content, the usage and the implementation when defining their design

systems.

So try to find two other design systems and find out exactly how they express their design systems.

Find two really amazing components from these design systems, and make sure you submit an assignment

so that we can all learn about it, talk about it and share some feedback.
