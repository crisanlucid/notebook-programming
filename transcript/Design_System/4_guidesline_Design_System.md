As an engineer, you need to understand exactly what your role is going to be when designing or developing

a design system.

Now, this course is focused on architecture and design systems, but you need to understand the design

aspect of it.

That way you can meet the product managers and designers halfway.

Your responsibility as an engineer would be to translate the guidelines of the design system into reusable

code that can be used to create products easily in future.

Again, your responsibility as an engineer would be to translate the design system into reusable code

that can be used to create products in future.

Now, let's say there's a guideline for the cholos that should be used.

You most likely wouldn't be the one choosing this close because you are an engineer, but you would

need to create a system where these colors would be reusable across different seams and across different

products.

So that's the focus of this course on the stand in the system extracting.

Reusable data out of the system and creating some sort of reusable code that can be used to represent

this design system in different products.

So I'll give you a good example from the project would be working on.

So I'll go to GitHub to come back to the slides that e which is our product, and visit the packages

and success.

And the source order, and you would realize that we have a foundation for the notice that in the policies

designed system for Shopify, that is a foundation section of our foundation for that is going to represent

almost the same thing.

We have a clause that says and this defines a set of laws just exactly like the set of laws defined

here.

So we extract this from the design system and we represent them in reusable code so that other teams

across the company can reuse them or other products.

Can we use them?

That's your responsibility as an engineer.

So you wouldn't only be extracting the cost.

Of course, you be extracting all of the reusable parts.

So we have cholos, we have typography, just like in our foundation here we have typography, then

we have space in which is a space system defining exactly how space should be managed in the design

system.

And we have exactly that also represented in court.

So as an engineer, you need to understand the design system and be able to extract these values.

Now, if the components section.

This is the second level of implementing or architects in the design system.

This is the base of the foundation and then this is the actual implementation level.

Now, how do users perform actions at Shopify?

This is what an action represents, this wouldn't be functional at first, you would be handed a design

from FEMA or sketch or envision, and this would have a representation of what that design should look

like.

Again, I would use an example, which is the system we are going to be working on.

So this is a FEMA foul and it's a visual representation of the different parts of our design system

coming together to create products.

So if you look at this, these interfaces that represents or composed a design system together.

So your role as an engineer would be to look at the interfaces and transform them into reusable components,

making sure that you extract the system from the reusable components.

So at Shopify, they have a button component and they give you a visual representation of that button,

which is this.

And as an engineer, you would be required to implement this button.

So that is reusable across teams or across projects.

Now, the design system would also define what is important when creating a button.

Is it accessibility, is it reusability, is it composition?

And you would need to take all of these things into account when creating the components.

So, again, number one, your role as an engineer is to understand the design system given to you by

the design team or by the company.

Number two, you would need to be able to extract reusable functionality out of the design system into

code, which is what we are focused on doing in this course.

And number three, you would need to be able to represent components of this design system in your preferred

coding language, making sure that it is reusable across teams and across products, and strictly respects

the guidelines of the design system.
