Let's talk about design systems.

Imagine working for a company called Shopify at this company.

There is a Web application and iOS application and an Android application.

The developers on the Web do not have a designer, so they improvise the components, use bootstrap

and design, whatever they like.

The developers on Android do not also have a designer, so they use the native components, tweak the

access and design whatever they like.

Same thing with the other developers.

Now what happens is when a customer uses the Web app and downloads the mobile app, the customer is

confused because the experience is completely different and it's really a pain if you're in that kind

of situation.

So what the companies do, they decided to get a bunch of designers put out managers and engineers who

would collaborate together to create a system that could be consistent across all these different platforms.

So a design system is kind of an agreement that defines how a company or a set of people working together

would build products.

So the engineers, designers and put out managers at Shopify came together and they said, OK, for

our buttons, we are going to use blue buttons from now on.

That way, if the US, Android or Web developers want to create buttons, they are going to use exactly

the same button specified by the system so that we no one is improvising, but everyone is following

a set of rules.

Now, this goes way beyond buttons.

It even goes into the language that content creators at Shopify use to create content, for example.

What do you want your customers to perceive when listening to you?

Do you want to have a heart tone?

Do you want to have a soft tune?

All the blog posts on your blog should actually sound the same, it should be the same feel, it should

be a joyful feel or a sad feel, whatever the company agrees on.

So if we have 10 people writing articles, then the articles should be completely different from each

other.

There should be a system in place and a set of guidelines to define how the company should represent

itself.

So that's what a design system is, a set of agreed upon rules that a group of people can follow to

develop products.

So this is Shopify is designed system.

Let's look at what it entails.

First, there is a foundation and this is where they talk about the main pieces of their design system.

First of all, most importantly, in their design system, they talk about their experience values.

How do they want their customers to experience their products across all their platforms?

Number one, they talk about being considerate.

If a button is supposed to be clicked and it's difficult to click or it's difficult to whoever that

goes against the guidelines of the Shopify design system.

So they explain right here how to make sure that whatever you build, whatever products you build,

have consideration for the customers, empowering, crafted, efficient, familiar and trustworthy.

So these are the values for their design system.

Next, they have accessibility.

They want to make sure that whatever components, whatever parts, whatever experiences are created,

they must be accessible for all people.

A violation of this principle is a violation of the design system at Shopify.

Number three, internationalization.

If you are creating a blog post, you have to take into consideration the fact that Shopify is a global

business and would not only be read by native English speakers, that's one of their core principles.

Information architecture, how would the information in the company be structured both for customers

and for employees of the company?

All of these guidelines define a system that everyone, engineers, product managers all have to respect

when creating content software products at the company.

Now, they also have a content section.

And this is where the specify the voice and the tone that should be used when communicating with customers

and mentions.

They also have grammar and mechanics talking about what sounds better, the specific rules when creating

written content for customers.

So this would apply to those that are creating blog post contents, video courses and all sorts of content

for customers.

So they want to make sure that Shopify sounds exactly the same no matter who is creating the content.

There's also the naming, the actionable language content mentions of customer content and all of that.

So this defines a set of guidelines that everyone should follow.

So they have the design.

What should the application look like?

What should the product look like?

Now they have a set of colors that define the culture of Shopify.

So, for example, if you're developing a product and you have some sort of pink color, then that would

go against the design system in place.

So they talk about the color combinations.

How should you use this colors in what scenarios?

And that's really good that we're all products created by shop.

If I look exactly the same, no matter the team of developers or the team of product managers or the

team of designers that work on the product.

Once there's a system in place, everybody follows the system.

Now they also talk about typography.

The fonts used on the website can speak tones about that company.

For example, if you use a graffiti font, it's completely a different message from using a premium.

So fonts, which communicates something else completely.

They also talk about the illustrations, what kind of illustrations should be used.

So all of these things are put in place so that every product, every blog post, every cause, every

piece of content created at Shopify is strictly consistent.

So the key word here is consistency.

We want to make sure that everyone at the company follows the same set of rules so that all products

are consistent, all content is consistent, all language is consistent.

All experiences are consistent.
